# PDFToolHelper
PDF Tool Helper is not more than a simple GUI (made with JavaFX) wrapper around pdfbox (pdfbox.apache.org).

As said, this project makes use of pdfbox.

The reason why this project existes is because it was a way to force myself to learn Maven, including tests.

Currently, Split, Merge and Change Quality are suported. I will add the Convert when i have time. 
Not only, i would like to add a few more tests.

Because of all the above reasons, considere this project as in a alpha stage.
